# Real Estate Analytics Toolkit

This repo contains two independent but complementary projects focused on residential real estate analysis:

### 1. **Good Deal Detector**
A machine-learning pipeline that identifies underpriced properties based on historical sales data. Includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.

### 2. **ROI Simulator**
A financial model that estimates investment returns for potential flips or rentals. Allows scenario testing based on renovation budgets, holding periods, financing structures, and market assumptions.

Each project has its own folder with a dedicated README explaining data requirements, setup, methodology, and usage.

This repo is under active development.
